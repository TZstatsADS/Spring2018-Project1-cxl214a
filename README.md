### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2018

+ Projec title: Is the Dow Jones Average affected by the sentiment scores of the presidents' inaugurations?
+ This project is conducted by [Xinlei Cao]

+ Project summary: Since the inauguration speech of president always reflect his plan for next 100 days or 4 years. A positive speech could raise the citizens' confidence for the next days, therefore, it could affect the financial market in some extent. Based on this intuition, I guess that maybe we can find the relation between change of the Dow Jones Average in that month when the president made the speech and the sentiment scores of the presidents' inaugurations.
